        <li>In designing for paper, the product has a set dimensionality. For example, whether the end poster is an A4 or an A5. However, on the screen, the dimensionality varies by the dimension of the device the user is using, which creates a new variable that the designer has to consider.</li>

            Apple.com exemplifies an effective design. The pages are minimalistic, with little to no color variation. However, through the use of scale and variation in layout, Apple achieved hierarchy and visual interest throughout their page, capturing customer's attention while communicating their products.

            Commencal's website is an example of effective communication. Despite their design feeling generic, their information organization is especially efficient. At the top, they show the most important bike they are selling. Moving down, they have all the bikes they sell laid out in a carousel format. And finally, there are sponsored videos at the bottom to build your trust in the brand.
